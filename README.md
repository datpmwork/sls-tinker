**Seamless Local-to-Lambda Tinker Bridge with State Persistence**

`sls-tinker` revolutionizes debugging and development for serverless Laravel applications by creating a transparent bridge between your local Tinker session and remote Lambda execution. Experience the familiar comfort of your local `php artisan tinker` while executing commands directly against your production Lambda environment with full state preservation across commands.

Unlike traditional approaches that require web interfaces or SSH access, this package maintains the native Tinker experience you know and love, while seamlessly forwarding each command to your remote Lambda function and preserving the execution state for subsequent commands.

## Support us

You can support this project via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/datpmwork).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require datpmwork/sls-tinker
```

## 🚀 How It Works

```bash
# Start local tinker that connects to your Lambda
bash-4.2# php artisan sls-tinker lambda-function-name
> Psy Shell v0.11.22 (PHP 8.2.29 — cli) by Justin Hileman
> You're running Tinker in AWS Lambda
> Target Lambda: lambda-function-name
```

```php
> $a = 1 # Assign variable
= 1 # Result from remote execution

> $a + 3 # Use variable in next command
= 4 # Result from remote execution

> $u = User::first() # Use Eloquent model
[!] Aliasing 'User' to 'App\Models\User' for this Tinker session.⏎
= App\Models\User {#6616  # Eloquent model fetched from remote
    id: 1,
    name: "Pham Minh Dat",
    email: "datpm@example.com",
    email_verified_at: null,
    created_at: "2025-02-06 14:57:18",
    updated_at: "2025-02-06 14:57:16",
    avatar: null,
  }

> $u->update(['name' => 'datpmwork']) # Update model attribute
= true # Result from remote execution

> $u
= App\Models\User {#6638  # Updated model fetched from remote
    id: 1,
    name: "datpmwork",
    email: "datpm@example.com",
    email_verified_at: null,
    created_at: "2025-02-06 14:57:18",
    updated_at: "2025-08-23 15:36:57",
    avatar: null,
  }
```

## ✨ Key Features

- 🖥️ **Native Local Experience** - Use your familiar local Tinker interface and shortcuts
- ⚡ **Lambda Execution** - Every command runs on your actual Lambda environment
- 💾 **Stateful Sessions** - Variables and state persist across commands seamlessly
- 🔄 **Automatic State Sync** - Previous command context automatically sent with each request
- 🌐 **Multi-Environment** - Switch between different Lambda deployments (staging, production)
- 🔍 **Full Laravel Integration** - Access models, services, facades - everything works as expected
- 📝 **Command History** - Full history support with up/down arrow navigation
- 🏃‍♂️ **Performance Optimized** - Efficient state serialization and minimal overhead

## Why This Approach?

**Traditional serverless debugging problems:**
- No SSH access to Lambda functions
- Can't run interactive commands in production
- Web-based tools feel foreign and limited
- State doesn't persist between commands
- Complex setup and authentication

**`sls-tinker` Solution:**
- Keep using your local terminal and favorite tools
- Execute commands in the actual production environment
- Seamless state management across command invocations
- Zero learning curve - it's just Tinker
- Simple configuration and authentication

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="sls-tinker-config"
```

## Testing

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest
